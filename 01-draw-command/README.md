Draw Command based renderer / architecture

## Rationale

Instead of saying:

> set line width to 2, set color to red, draw rect (and remember what Iâ€™ve just told you)

You say:

> draw({ shape: red, width: 2, color: red})

And you can save that state objects, replay them, drop them, filter them, log them...

So more game engine like, more functional, more virtual dom like, less hidden state dragging around.
